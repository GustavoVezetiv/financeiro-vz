# Database Model

## Principles

The database should enforce user ownership and make financial responsibility explicit.

Core principles:

- Every user-owned business table should include `user_id`.
- Row Level Security should ensure users only access their own records.
- Reimbursements must be first-class entities, not generic income rows.
- Income, reimbursement, and third-party money must be distinguishable.
- Imported data should remain staged until reviewed and accepted.
- Financial records should preserve enough context to support monthly decisions.

Recommended common fields for most tables:

- `id`: primary key, preferably UUID.
- `user_id`: owner, linked to `auth.users`.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: nullable soft-delete timestamp where useful.

## Entity Overview

### users/profile

Supabase Auth provides `auth.users`. The application should create a related `profiles` table.

Purpose:

- Store application-specific user information.
- Keep preferences separate from authentication data.

Important fields:

- `id`: UUID, same value as `auth.users.id`.
- `display_name`: user-facing name.
- `currency`: default currency, initially `BRL`.

Relationships:

- One profile belongs to one authenticated user.
- All user-owned records reference this user through `user_id`.

## Relationship Summary

- `profiles.id` maps to `auth.users.id`.
- Most tables include `user_id` for ownership and RLS policies.
- `people` connects responsible third parties to reimbursements and transactions.
- `credit_cards` have many `credit_card_invoices`.
- `credit_card_invoices` have many `credit_card_transactions`.
- `credit_card_transactions` can create or link to `reimbursements`.
- `reimbursements` link expected Pix inflows to original expenses and responsible people.
- `payment_plans` group monthly decision items.
- `payment_plan_items` reference payables, invoices, planned purchases, goals, or manual decisions.
- `import_batches` and `import_rows` stage imported CSV/XLSX data before official persistence.

## Row Level Security Direction

Each user-owned table should have policies similar to:

- Users can select rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Users can insert rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Users can update rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`.
- Users can delete or soft-delete rows where `user_id = auth.uid()`.

For `profiles`, users should only access their own profile row where `id = auth.uid()`.
